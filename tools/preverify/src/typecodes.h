/*
 * Type codes  6/12/91

    This typecode system allows us to represent the type
    of scalars in a uniform way. For instance, all integer types
    have some bits in common, and are distinguished by a built-in
    size field. Types without multiple sizes don't have a size field.

    Scalars may only have sizes which are powers of 2. The size
    field holds the log-based-2 of the object's size.

    All run-time types can be encoded in 4 bits. There are more
    compile- time types. These fit in 5 bits.
    Schematically, we have:
        +----+----+----+----+----+
        | c  |    t    |    s    |
        +----+----+----+----+----+

        Encoding is:
           c   t  s    type
        -------------------------
           0  00 00    unassigned
           0  00 01    array
           0  00 10    class
           0  00 11    proxy    (OBSOLETE)
           0  01 00    boolean (1 byte)
           0  01 01    char    (2 bytes)
           0  01 1s    float (single=1; double=2)
           0  1u xx    integer (byte=0; short=1; int=2; long=3;
                     u=1 => unsigned)

            For runtime types, the size of an object
            is 1<<(t&3)

           1  00 00    typedef    (compiler only)
           1  00 01    void    (compiler only)
           1  00 10    func    (compiler only)
           1  00 11    unknown (compiler only)
           1  01 00     error   (compiler only)

    Char and Boolean are not int's because they need a different signature,
    so have to be distinguishable, even at runtime. We allow arrays
    of objects, arrays(?), booleans, char, integers, and floats.
    Note that the low-order two bits of all these gives the log of
    the size, except for arrays, of course.

    I would prefer not to have unsigned int in the language, but
    don't want to make that decision at this level. We could come up
    with a better encoding of boolean and char if there were no
    unsigned.

    The compile-only type values that could be confused with the 
    integer and float scalar types must not ever be used. Value 0 must
    not be assigned a runtime type, as this is used for some non-trivial
    solution in punning types and pointer. In fact, we even have a name
    for it.
